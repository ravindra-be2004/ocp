# Design Notes

## Motivation

To run software such as MySQL or Elasticsearch, it would be nice to use
local fast storages and form a cluster to replicate data between servers.

TopoLVM provides a storage driver for such software running on Kubernetes.

## Goals

- Use LVM for flexible volume capacity management.
- Enhance the scheduler to prefer nodes having a larger storage capacity.
- Support dynamic volume provisioning from PVC.
- Support volume resizing (resizing for CSI becomes beta in Kubernetes 1.16).

## Components

- `topolvm-controller`: CSI controller service.
- `topolvm-scheduler`: A [scheduler extender](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/scheduling/scheduler_extender.md) for TopoLVM.
- `topolvm-node`: CSI node service.
- `LVMd`: gRPC service to manage LVM volumes.

## Architecture

TopoLVM is a storage plugin based on [CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/).
Therefore, the architecture basically follows the one described in
https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ .

`LVMd` responds to manage LVM.
It provides gRPC services via UNIX domain socket to create/update/delete
LVM logical volumes and watch a volume group status.
It runs as a dedicated process or a embed function in `topolvm-node`.

`topolvm-node` implements CSI node services as well as miscellaneous control
on each Node.  It communicates with `LVMd` to watch changes in free space
of a volume group and exports the information by annotating Kubernetes
`Node` resource of the running node.  In the meantime, it adds a finalizer
to the `Node` to clean up PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC) bound on the node. It also works as a custom Kubernetes controller to implement
dynamic volume provisioning.  Details are described in the following sections.

`topolvm-controller` implements CSI controller services.  It also works as
a custom Kubernetes controller to implement dynamic volume provisioning and
resource cleanups.

`topolvm-scheduler` is a [scheduler extender](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/scheduling/scheduler_extender.md) to extend the
standard Kubernetes scheduler for TopoLVM.

### How the Scheduler Extension Works

To extend the standard scheduler, TopoLVM components work together as follows:

- `topolvm-node` exposes free storage capacity as `capacity.topolvm.io/<device-class>` annotation of each Node.
- `topolvm-controller` works as a [mutating webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) for new Pods.
    - It adds `capacity.topolvm.io/<device-class>` annotation to a pod and `topolvm.io/capacity` resource to the first container of a pod.
    - The value of the annotation is the sum of the storage capacity requests of unbound TopoLVM PVCs for each volume group referenced by the pod.
- `topolvm-scheduler` filters and scores Nodes for a new pod having `topolvm.io/capacity` resource request.
    - Nodes having less capacity in given volume group than requested are filtered.
    - Nodes having larger capacity in given volume group are scored higher.

#### Why Doesn't TopoLVM Use Extended Resources?

Quick answer: Using extended resources prevents PVC from being resized.

[Extended resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#extended-resources) are a Kubernetes feature to allow users to define arbitrary resources consumed by Pods.

What is good in extended resources is that `kube-scheduler` takes them into account for Pod scheduling.
However, using extended resources to schedule pods onto nodes with sufficient capacity has several issues.

One problem is that the resource requests need to be copied from PVC to Pods.
For example, if a Pod has two PVC requesting 10 GiB and 20 GiB storage, the Pod should request 30 GiB storage capacity.

The biggest problem appears when PVC get resized.  Suppose that a node has 100 GiB storage capacity as an extended resource, and a Pod with PVC requesting 50 GiB of storage is scheduled to the node.  If PVC is resized to 80 GiB, the remaining storage becomes 20 GiB.

To keep track of the volume _usage_, the Pod should now request 80 GiB storage.  But this is impossible because `kube-apiserver` does not allow editing Pod resource requests.  As a consequence, `kube-scheduler` fails to notice the change in storage usage.

TopoLVM, on the other hand, keeps track of the volume _free_ capacity through annotations of nodes.
TopoLVM's extended scheduler `topolvm-scheduler` ignores the current usage.  It only cares if a node has sufficient _free_ capacity for new Pods.

### How Dynamic Provisioning Works

To support dynamic volume provisioning, CSI controller service need to create a
logical volume on remote target nodes.  In general, CSI controller runs on a
different node from the target node of the volume.  To allow communication
between CSI controller and the target node, TopoLVM uses a custom resource
called `LogicalVolume`.

Dynamic provisioning depends on [CSI `external-provisioner`](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/external-provisioner.html) sidecar container.

1. `external-provisioner` finds a new unbound PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for TopoLVM.
2. `external-provisioner` calls CSI controller's `CreateVolume` with the topology key of the target node.
3. `topolvm-controller` creates a `LogicalVolume` with the topology key and capacity of the volume.
4. `topolvm-node` on the target node finds the `LogicalVolume`.
5. `topolvm-node` sends a volume create request to `LVMd`.
6. `LVMd` creates an LVM logical volume as requested.
7. `topolvm-node` updates the status of `LogicalVolume`.
8.  `topolvm-controller` finds the updated status of `LogicalVolume`.
9.  `topolvm-controller` sends the success (or failure) to `external-provisioner`.
10. `external-provisioner` creates a PersistentVolume (PV) and binds it to the PVC.

### How Volume Expansion Works

When the requested size of PVC is expanded, `ControllerExpandVolume` of `topolvm-controller` is called to
change the `.spec.size` of the corresponding `LogicalVolume` resource.

If there is a difference between `logicalvolume.spec.size` and `logicalvolume.status.currentSize`,
it means that the logical volume corresponding to the `LogicalVolume` resource should be expanded.
So in that case, `topolvm-node` sends `ResizeLV` request to `LVMd`.
If it receives a successful response, `topolvm-node` updates `logicalvolume.status.currentSize`.
If it receives an erroneous response, it updates the `.status.code` and `.status.message` field with the error.

Then, if the logical volume is not a block device, `topolvm-node` resizes the filesystem of the logical volume
via `NodeExpandVolume` or `NodePublishVolume`.
If the filesystem requires offline resizing, the administrator should make `LogicalVolume` offline beforehand.
The resizing is performed in `NodePublishVolume` in this case.
If the filesystem is resized online, the resizing is performed in `NodeExpandVolume`.
Currently, all supported filesystems can be resized online, so `NodePublishVolume` is not involved with resizing.

## Limitations

TopoLVM depends on Kubernetes deeply.
Portability to other container orchestrators (CO) is not considered.
